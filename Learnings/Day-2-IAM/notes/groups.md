# IAM Groups

## What are Groups?
- IAM Groups are **collections of IAM users**.
- Policies attached to a group automatically apply to all users in it.

## Creating Groups
- Go to IAM Console → Groups → Create New Group.
- Name the group (e.g., Admins, Developers).
- Attach **policies** to the group.

## Benefits
- Easier management of permissions.
- Consistency across multiple users.
