# Day-5: AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store) - Description

## 1. Introduction
Amazon **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** is a type of storage service provided by AWS.  
Think of it like a **hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD)** that you can attach to your **Amazon EC2 instances**.  
The special thing about EBS is that your data is **not lost** even if you stop or restart your EC2 instance.  

EBS volumes are created in a specific **Availability Zone (AZ)** and must be attached to an EC2 instance in the same AZ.  
They can be detached from one EC2 and attached to another when needed.

## 2. Why Use EBS?
- To store data that must **persist** after an EC2 instance is stopped.  
- To run applications like **databases, web servers, or analytics workloads**.  
- To easily take **backups** using snapshots.  
- To scale storage **independently of compute power**.

## 3. Key Features
- **Persistent Storage**: Data is saved even if the EC2 instance is stopped or restarted.  
- **Highly Available**: Data is replicated automatically within the AZ for reliability.  
- **Scalable**: You can start from 1 GB and go up to 16 TB per volume.  
- **Snapshots**: You can create a backup (snapshot) at any point in time.  
- **Attach/Detach**: You can attach an EBS volume to a running instance or detach it when not needed.

## 4. Volume Types
Amazon EBS provides different volume types depending on use case:

1. **gp3 (General Purpose SSD)**  
   - Default volume type.  
   - Good balance of cost and performance.  
   - Used for most workloads like websites, dev/test, general apps.  

2. **io1 / io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)**  
   - High-performance SSD volumes.  
   - Provide high IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second).  
   - Best for **databases** and **critical enterprise applications**.  

3. **st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)**  
   - Low-cost HDD with good throughput.  
   - Suitable for **big data, data warehousing, and log processing**.  

4. **sc1 (Cold HDD)**  
   - Very cheap HDD storage.  
   - For data that is rarely accessed (like backups or archives).

## 5. Snapshots
- A **snapshot** is a **backup** of an EBS volume at a certain point in time.  
- Snapshots are stored in **Amazon S3** (internally managed by AWS).  
- You can use snapshots to:
  - Restore a volume after data loss.  
  - Create new volumes.  
  - Create an **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**.  
- Snapshots are **incremental**: only changes since the last snapshot are saved, saving space and cost.  

---

## 6. Common Use Cases
- Root volume for EC2 instances (stores operating system and files).  
- Storage for **applications** (websites, software).  
- **Databases** like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.  
- Backup and recovery.  
- Big data and analytics.  

---

## 7. Pricing
You pay for:
- **Volume size (GB per month)**  
- **Snapshot storage (GB per month)**  
- **Provisioned IOPS** (if using high-performance volumes like io1/io2)

## 8. Important AWS CLI Commands
```bash
# Create volume
aws ec2 create-volume --availability-zone us-east-1a --size 10 --volume-type gp3
