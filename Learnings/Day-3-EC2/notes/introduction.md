# Introduction to AWS EC2

**EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)** is a cloud service that provides resizable virtual servers called **instances** to run applications.

Key Points:
- Pay only for what you use.
- Scale up or down easily (elasticity).
- Accessible globally.
- Customizable OS, CPU, RAM, storage, network.

Example:
Instead of buying physical servers, AWS EC2 allows you to rent virtual servers in the cloud.
